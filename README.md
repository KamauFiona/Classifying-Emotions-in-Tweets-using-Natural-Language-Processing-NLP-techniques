# Classifying-Emotions-in-Tweets-using-Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-techniques
This project brings tweets to life by uncovering the emotions hidden in everyday social media posts using the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP). By training a model to detect feelings like joy, sadness, anger, and surprise, it transforms raw text into meaningful emotional insight. In a world where millions share their thoughts online every second, understanding these emotions isn’t just useful, it’s essential. Whether it’s tracking public reactions to global events or helping businesses connect with their audience, this project shows how NLP can decode the heartbeat of digital conversations and turn tweets into powerful stories of human emotion.
