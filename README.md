# Classifying-Emotions-in-Tweets-using-Natural-Language-Processing-NLP-techniques
Developed a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model to classify emotions expressed in tweets—such as joy, sadness, anger, and surprise—by leveraging a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project involved cleaning and preprocessing raw text data, transforming it using tokenization and word embeddings, and training a CNN to capture emotional features in short-form social media content. The final model achieved high accuracy in emotion detection, demonstrating deep learning’s capability to extract nuanced sentiment patterns from text. This project highlighted the practical use of AI in understanding public sentiment and can be applied in areas such as brand monitoring, mental health analysis, and customer feedback systems.
